  <h1>Chicken Pot Pie</h1>

  <h3>Description</h3>
  <p>Originally published in 2014, this is my very favorite chicken pot pie recipe. 
    If you haven’t tried it in the past several years, I bet it will be your new favorite, too!
    The reader-loved recipe uses my homemade pie crust (it’s not just for Thanksgiving pies, after all!) for a sturdy base on the bottom and a golden, flaky cloak on top. 
    In between the pie crust layers is a mixture of chicken and veggies in a creamy, rich white gravy that is full of flavor. 
    It goes without saying that this double-crust chicken pot pie is the ultimate in comfort food.</p>

  <h3>Ingredients</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Homemade Pie Crust or All Butter Pie Crust (both recipes make 2 crusts, 1 for bottom and 1 for top)</li>
    <li>1 pound (450g) skinless boneless chicken breast or thighs, cubed</li>
    <li>1 cup (about 130g) sliced carrots (about 2 carrots)</li>
    <li>1/2 cup (about 40g) sliced celery</li>
    <li>1/3 cup (5 Tbsp; 71g) unsalted butter</li>
    <li>1/3 cup (45g) chopped yellow onion (1/2 of a small onion)</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon minced garlic</li>
    <li>1/3 cup (41g) all-purpose flour</li>
    <li>3/4 teaspoon salt</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon dried thyme leaves</li>
    <li>1 and 3/4 cups (420ml) chicken broth/stock (I recommend reduced sodium)</li>
    <li>2/3 cup (160ml) half-and-half*</li>
    <li>1 cup (125g) frozen peas</li>
    <li>egg wash: 1 large egg beaten with 1 Tablespoon (15ml) milk</li>
    <li>optional: sprigs of fresh thyme for garnish</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h3>Steps</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>The crust: Prepare either pie crust recipe through step 5, including chilling for at least 2 hours. 
        I usually make the crust the night before. 
        The pie crust recipe makes 2 crusts and you’ll be using both crusts.</li>
    <li>In a large pot, combine chicken, carrots, and celery. 
        Add enough water to cover the chicken and vegetables, then place over medium-high heat. 
        Bring to a boil, then allow to boil for 10 minutes. 
        Remove from heat, drain, and set aside.</li>
    <li>In a large skillet over medium heat, combine the butter, onions, and garlic. 
        Stirring occasionally, cook until the onions are translucent and the butter is lightly browning.
        Whisk in the flour, salt, black pepper, thyme, chicken broth, and half-and-half. 
        Cook and whisk until no flour lumps remain, then simmer over medium-low heat until thick. 
        I simmer mine for 10 minutes. 
        You want it to be a very thick gravy; simmer longer if necessary. 
        Taste and add more seasonings if you prefer. 
        Sometimes I add more thyme. 
        Remove from heat and set aside.</li>
    <li>Preheat oven to 425°F (218°C).</li>
    <li>After the pie dough has chilled: On a floured work surface, roll out one of the discs of chilled dough (keep the other one in the refrigerator). 
        Turn the dough about a quarter turn after every few rolls until you have a circle about 12 inches in diameter. 
        Carefully place the dough into a 9-inch pie dish that’s 1.5–2 inches deep. 
        Tuck the dough in with your fingers, making sure it is smooth. 
        With a small sharp knife or kitchen shears, trim the extra overhang of dough and discard.</li>
    <li>Spoon the chicken and vegetable mixture into the crust. 
        Scatter the frozen peas on top. 
        Pour/spread the gravy evenly over top.</li>
    <li>Roll out second half of pie crust dough just as you did the first. 
        Cover the pie with the second crust and trim the extra overhang off the sides. 
        Crimp the pie crust with a fork to seal the edges. 
        With a small sharp knife, slice a few small slits in the top crust to allow steam to escape. 
        Using a pastry brush, brush crust and edges with egg wash.</li>
    <li>Bake for 32–38 minutes or until the top of the crust is golden brown. 
        After 20 minutes of baking, be sure to cover the edges of the crust with aluminum foil or use a pie crust shield to prevent the edges from getting too brown.</li>
    <li>Remove from the oven and cool for at least 10 minutes before serving. 
        Makes amazing leftovers—the filling is so thick on the next day! 
        Reheat as desired. 
        Leftovers keep well in the refrigerator in an airtight container for up to 5 days.</li>
